# Polyhedron Game
This is a turn-based strategy game made in the Unity game engine. It is inspired by grand strategy games like Civilization V, but it takes place on a true three-dimensional, spherical planet.

## Goldberg Polyhedra
The maps are actually a set of fascinating figures called the Goldberg Polyhedra, made up of an arbitrarily large number of hexagons glued into a sphere with exactly 12 pentagons. Here are some renders we made using our polyhedron generation tool early in development:

This map shape adds to the realism of the game and gives the players more interesting geometry to explore when compared to the flat, square maps of games like Civilization V.

## Planned Features:
* Organically-growing cities and nations, based on economic simulations
* Scientific progress _without_ a formal tech tree
* Online multiplayer with robust, hassle-free dropping and rejoining of connections.
